# Bangla_digit_classification with TensorFlow
 
## Overview

This code demonstrates how to set up an image data generator using TensorFlow, particularly for image classification tasks. Image data generators are commonly used for preprocessing and augmenting images, making them suitable for deep learning models.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries and tools installed:

- TensorFlow (tensorflow)
- TensorFlow Keras ImageDataGenerator (tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator)

You can install TensorFlow using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
